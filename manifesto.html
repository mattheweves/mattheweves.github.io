        <p>
          It often times feels as if I’m on another planet. Looking down from far far away, there is distance and time between my own coding skills and understanding of software development and engineering, and those that I talk to and listen to.  And there definitely is.  A common phrase or thought shared amongst senior engineers is that the second you think or feel that you know a lot about software engineering and get comfortable is
          the second you've lost touch with just how complex this web is.  The planet they live on is an interesting one, lets call it, Planet CODE.  It is one of passion, community, competition, and lots and lots of building.  There are buildings EVERYWHERE, and since materials are so cheap, anyone can build anything they want.  This planet is a hard one to settle down in and live in, and to break in and get a spot within this community is brutally competitive.  They welcome you at the gates and say “anyone can do it,” but true software developers are in a whole other part of town and those guys don’t just work with anyone.
        </p><p>Those outside the planet, who don’t have any interest at all in living there, often say things like “I have no idea what they do there, or how it works. It is all magic. But what is their weird obsession with cats?"

          They know that amazing tools are produced there, like Uber, Yelp, Google Maps, Microsoft Office, and apps they use every day on their own planet, but most software development occurs far far away and never sees the light of day in the planet most human beings live in, let’s call it… Earth.
        </p><p>I must say, that I’ve dreamed of living on their planet and being a part of their community and doing the work they do.  It seems amazing to be so desired by companies, paid a high wage and have such respect, and I love their passion and dedication.  The problem for me is, my passion wears out because it often seems that there is no use for a lot of what is built back on planet Earth, and I love planet Earth.   Planet Earth is where my wife lives, and I’m raising my baby girl, and also where there are rivers and mountains and ocean to explore, and not much of what I’ve seen developed on planet CODE has really enabled me to enjoy those things much better.
        </p><p>I usually enjoy my runs the most when I turn off my GPS tracker and Spotify playlist and just listen to my breath, my feet pounding the ground, and the birds and wind.
        </p><p>I usually enjoy the woods and camping most when my laptop is far away, no emails can be checked, and my devices all say no service or no battery.
        </p><p>I enjoy time with my daughter most when I don’t have to snap a photo for every cute thing she does (I would never be able to put the phone down) and post it on a feed of snapshots for others to consume, like, or just pass by annoyed.
        </p><p>Notice I said “usually”, not always. I’m certainly an early adopter of technologies and always been intrigued by computers and machines, love to look at things being built in every category of Kickstarter, and spent many hours with a 3D Printer designing my own little gizmos.  However, the balance between technology that helps the world and belongs on another planet, that is a tough one to achieve.
        </p><p>My goal, is to be a herald for folks on Earth who don’t need any more crap, and to also find the best and most useful software built from planet CODE and bring it back to Earth to improve the lives of people living there.  I will continue to learn their languages and hope to understand them better, but not sure I will ever feel quite at home on Planet Code. I'm okay with that, because the second I do I’ve lost touch with what matters most; maximizing the time I have to make a difference on this beautiful Planet Earth and enjoy it along the way.
